## Presentation

**Context** : Predict air pressure system failures in Scania trucks.

**Project Recapitulation**: ðŸ‘‡

The aim of this project is to utilize data from a truck company regarding various breakdowns across different trucks to develop a model (AI) capable of predicting potential failures. The model will be trained on the available data to classify whether a truck might experience a breakdown based on its specific information.
