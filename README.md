## Presentation

**Context** : Predict air pressure system failures in Scania trucks.

**Project Recapitulation**: ðŸ‘‡

The aim of this project is to utilize data from a truck company regarding various breakdowns across different trucks to develop a model (AI) capable of predicting potential failures. The model will be trained on the available data to classify whether a truck might experience a breakdown based on its specific information.

## Gitlab Distribution

The root of our Gitlab consists of two essential folders for the project:

[**src**](src) : **Application code**

[**data**](data) : **Used data**

[**doc**](doc) : **Project Documentation**



## Random Forest

The most accurate solution, with more than 99% accuracy and good decision, is the random forest, with the following confusion matrix:
